## Data

All input and output is located in a directory with the following subdirectories:

    OBSINPUT:        Observation data pre-processed to weekly means as input for inversion
    MODINPUT:        Model output at observation sites pre-processed to weekly means as input for inversion
    OBSMODINPUT:     New version of pre-processed monthly observation and model data in netCDF format.
                     Replaces previous ASCII files in OBSINPUT and MODINPUT.
    RESULTS:         Output of inversion
    ERRORCOVARIANCE: Model-observation mismatch uncertainties at all stations computed with routine
                 inv_error_diagonal_weekly_brd.pro. Contains the following types of files
                 * inv_errorcovariance_stations_wm_mismatchonly_XX_YYYYMM.dat

                 Contains files of type inv_emissions_daily_YYYYMM.txt.
    SENSITIVITIES:   Monthly sensitivities of concentrations at stations to emissions from 48 categories.
                 Contains three files for each month:
                 * inv_names_weekly_XX_YYYYMM.txt: names of the stations in this month
                 * inv_dates_weekly_XX_YYYYMM.txt: dates for which sensitivities are valid

    CHOICE_MODELLEV: Selection of model levels (m above ground) at which FLEXPART is evaluated at the
                 individual stations. For the simulation with 62 flask sites, for example, the 
                 corresponding file is called choice_modellevel_station_62.dat.

    log:             Log files produced by run_inversion_final, e.g. contains
                 number and percentage of observations discarded in each year

## Running an inversion

**Main routine**

    run_inversion_final, sim=sim, dlr=dlr
  
    Keyword input parameter:
       /dlr: set this keyword to perform inversion on DLR's EMAC output instead of FLEXPART
    Output:
       sim : simulation structure
       
The inversion settings are defined through the following variables defined (hardcoded) at the beginning:

    run (string):     Inversion configuration name. The latest configuations used by Florian were 'NEW_DLR' and '22.4'
                      The configuration defines the a priori uncertainties per emission category
    sconfig (string): the station configuration. Current options are 'flask', 'all', 'special', 'brd', 'flask_DLR2'

The following processing steps can be activated (1) or deactivated (0)

    step1 = 0   ; create monthly files of weekly mean observation and model data
                ; needs to be called only once for FLEXPART or EMACs, since the output is
                ; generated for all available sites irrespective of the simulation settings
    step2 = 1   ; compute model-data mismatch first time
    step3 = 1   ; run preliminary inversion to compute aposteriori model-data mismatch
    step4 = 1   ; compute model-data mismatch second time using aposteriori model data
    step5 = 1   ; run final inversion
    step6 = 0   ; run plot programs


**Inversion settings**

Define directories and inversion settings depending on variables *run* and *sconfig* provided by main routine.

    sim = inv_configurations_brd(run=run,sconfig=sconfig,dlr=dlr,ok=ok)
    
    Inputs:
       run:     inversion configuration name (see above)
       sconfig: station configuration (e.g. 'flask' or 'all')
       dlr:     set dlr=1 to conduct inversion for DLR model output 
    Output:
       ok :     =1 if configuration was successful, i.e. if values of run and sconfig are know
       sim:     Simulation configuration structure
       
         sim = {name:name,$                ; simulation name, e.g. 'final_sim01'
